# AudioInEffects

- Added wavetable like tape effects, but you cant go fster than original speed, will noodle about 

- So max loop is 10 seconds and you just loop it from number of samples in complete loop (10 secs) - samples wanted in loop. So no time stretching. Will add a wavetable like thing next, for variable time stretching. So it's like the 480000 samples become a wavetable 

- There's a loop button that constantly records the last second, tomorrow change the harcoded sample length for looping buffer, so hopefully get tape like time changing
